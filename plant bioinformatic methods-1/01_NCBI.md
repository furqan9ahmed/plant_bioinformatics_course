# **Plant Bioinformatics Method-I** 
[Here is the link of this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bioinformatics-methods-1/lecture/gnPjk/lecture)

I started learning this course on 02.03.2022 after the presentation of progress report in IFAM, Uni Kiel, Germany.

> ## **What is bioinformatics?**
Bioinformatics:
- is the development of application of computational tools in manging all kinds of biological data
- involves the technology that uses computers for storage, retrieval, manipulation, and distribution of information related to biological macromolecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites
- generally limted to sequence, structural, and functional analysis of genes and genomes, and their corresponding products
- sometimes called computational molecular biology
---
This field has really developed in the past 15 years due to the efforts of genome sequencing projects, such as the [human genome sequencing project](https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project).

> ## **Why do we need bioinformatics?**

- How do we deal with three billion pieces of sequence information? 
- So why do we need bioinformatics? 
- Well, if you can imagine three billion letters in the human genome, three billion nucleotides, how do you really make sense of that without using computers? 

> ## Biological databases
> The other thing that bioinformatics is about is biological databases, how we can store these biological data
1. Why databases are used?
2. What is a database?
3. What are the Data structures: Flat file databses vs Rational databases?
4. Accession numbers and identifiers (genebank flat file format)
5. A pratical example of utility - NCBI Search (GQuery/Entrez).
