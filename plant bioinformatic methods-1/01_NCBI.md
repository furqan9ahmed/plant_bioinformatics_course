# **Plant Bioinformatics Method-I** 
[Here is the link of this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bioinformatics-methods-1/lecture/gnPjk/lecture)

I started learning this course on 02.03.2022 after the presentation of progress report in IFAM, Uni Kiel, Germany.

> ## What is bioinformatics?
Bioinformatics:
- is the development of application of computational tools in manging all kinds of biological data
- involves the technology that uses computers for storage, retrieval, manipulation, and distribution of information related to biological macromolecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites
- generally limted to sequence, structural, and functional analysis of genes and genomes, and their corresponding products
- sometimes called computational molecular biology

> This field has really developed in the past 15 years due to the efforts of genome sequencing projects, such as the [human genome sequencing project](https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project).


How do we deal with three billion pieces of sequence information? So why do we need bioinformatics? Well, if you can imagine three billion letters in the human genome, three billion nucleotides, how do you really make sense of that without using computers? So this is just a small section of a human genome encompassing the human globin gene. We would like to know about which parts of the genome are important, that code for proteins for instance. Without using computers, we would never know that this region here or this region here actually comprise an exon of the globin gene. That is a piece of the gene that actually codes for protein. The other thing that bioinformatics is about is biological databases, how we can store these biological data. We'll talk a little bit about what a database is, data structures, flat file databases versus relational databases. We'll talk also about accession numbers and identifiers, and we'll go over the GenBank flat file format, and we'll just touch briefly on a practical example of utility using NCBI's Entrez / GQuery / Search.
